mupd - CurseForge Addon Update Script

This script updates addons for World of Warcraft retail by downloading the latest versions from CurseForge.
It reads a list of CurseForge addon URLs from list.txt in the specified addon directory.

Dependencies:

  bash
  curl
  htmlq
  jq
  7z

Usage:

./mupd <addon_directory>

  Replace <addon_directory> with the path to your addon directory, which should contain a list.txt file with CurseForge addon URLs.
  Optional -v flag for verbose output.

Example list.txt:

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/baganator
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-maps
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2

  Make sure each line in your list.txt contains a valid CurseForge addon URL.
  Replace these example URLs with the actual URLs of the addons you want to update.

Notes:

  Initially a rough script, improved for error handling and output using gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp.
  It stupidly deletes *AddonName* before extracting a new version. I haven't had problems.
  Works on retail only because it always takes the latest "main file" from CurseForge.
